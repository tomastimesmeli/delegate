## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### The Process:
1. **Work for 25 minutes** (one "Pomodoro")
2. **Take a 5-minute short break**
3. **Repeat steps 1-2**
4. **After 4 Pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break**

### Benefits:
- **Improved focus** by working in short, manageable chunks
- **Reduced mental fatigue** through regular breaks
- **Better time awareness** and estimation
- **Increased productivity** and motivation
- **Reduced anxiety** about large tasks
